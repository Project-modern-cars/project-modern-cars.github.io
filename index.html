<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Cars have evolved significantly over the years. In the past, vehicles were designed only
        for basic transportation. Today, modern cars are equipped with advanced technology that
        improves safety, comfort, performance, and efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of electronics, computers, and smart systems has changed the way cars operate.
        Modern vehicles are now capable of assisting drivers and making travel safer and easier.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Key Technologies in Modern Cars</h2>
    <p>
        Modern cars use electronic control units (ECUs) to manage different functions of the vehicle.
        These systems control engine performance, braking, steering, and fuel efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
        Features such as digital dashboards, GPS navigation systems, touchscreen displays, and
        voice control have made driving more convenient and user-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many cars also support smartphone connectivity, allowing drivers to access calls, music,
        and navigation safely while driving.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Safety Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        Safety is one of the most important aspects of modern car design. Basic safety features like
        seat belts and airbags are now supported by advanced safety systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Technologies such as Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Stability Control (ESC),
        parking sensors, and rear-view cameras help reduce accidents and improve road safety.
    </p>
    <p>
        Advanced systems like lane assist and automatic emergency braking help protect passengers
        and pedestrians.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Electric and Hybrid Vehicles</h2>
    <p>
        Electric and hybrid vehicles are becoming popular due to increasing fuel prices and
        environmental concerns. These vehicles use electric motors and batteries to reduce fuel
        consumption and pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hybrid cars use both fuel engines and electric motors, while electric cars operate fully on
        battery power. This helps reduce harmful emissions and conserve natural resources.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Future of Car Technology</h2>
    <p>
        The future of car technology includes self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and smart
        traffic systems. These technologies aim to reduce human error and improve road safety.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the coming years, cars are expected to become more intelligent, efficient, and
        environmentally friendly, shaping the future of transportation.

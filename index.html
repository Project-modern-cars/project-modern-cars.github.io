<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The development of modern technology has made cars <font>smarter and safer</font>. Modern cars use electronic
systems, sensors, and computer programs to help drivers while driving. These technologies reduce
human effort and increase road safety.
</p>
<p>
Cars today are designed not only for speed and comfort but also for environmental protection and
energy efficiency. This makes modern vehicles more reliable and user-friendly.

<h2>Key Technologies in Modern Cars</h2>
<p>
Modern cars are equipped with electronic control units that manage various functions such as engine
performance, braking, steering, and fuel injection. These systems help the car run <b>smoothly and
efficiently</b> in different conditions.
</p>
<p>
Digital dashboards, touchscreen displays, GPS navigation systems, and voice control features have
made driving easier. Drivers can now access information and control many features with minimal
effort.
</p>
<p>
Many modern cars also support mobile phone connectivity, allowing drivers to use calls, music,
and navigation safely while driving.
</p>
<h2>Safety Technologies</h2>
<p>
Safety is one of the most important aspects of modern car technology. Basic safety features like
<font>seat belts and airbags</font> are now combined with advanced safety systems to protect passengers.
</p>
<p>
Technologies such as Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Stability Control (ESC), parking
sensors, and rear-view cameras help prevent accidents and improve overall road safety.
</p>
<p>
Advanced driver assistance systems like lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking
reduce the risk of collisions.
</p>

<h2>Electric and Hybrid Cars</h2>
<p>
Electric and hybrid cars are becoming popular due to increasing fuel prices and environmental
pollution. These cars use electric motors and batteries to reduce fuel consumption and harmful
emissions.
</p>
<p>
Hybrid cars use both fuel engines and electric motors, while electric cars run completely on
battery power. These vehicles are more<font> eco-friendly</font> and help conserve natural resources.

<h2>Future of Car Technology</h2>
<p>
The future of car technology includes <font>self-driving cars and smart traffic systems</font>. Self-driving
cars use artificial intelligence, sensors, and cameras to drive without human control.
</p>
<p>
In the future, cars may be able to communicate with each other and traffic signals to reduce
traffic jams and accidents. This will make transportation safer and more efficient.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Modern technology has transformed cars into advanced machines that provide safety, comfort, and
efficiency. With continuous innovation, cars will become even more intelligent and environmentally
friendly in the coming years.<br>

        <h2>Key Technologies in Modern Cars</h2>
        <p>
          Today’s vehicles use powerful onboard computers and sensors to control various functions.
          Touchscreen infotainment systems, GPS navigation, voice commands, and digital dashboards
          provide drivers with a smooth and user-friendly experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Connectivity features like Bluetooth and smartphone integration allow drivers to access
          calls, music, and navigation safely while driving.

  <!-- Safety -->
  <section>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Safety Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          Safety is one of the most important aspects of modern car design. Technologies such as
          Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), airbags, traction control, and electronic stability control
          help reduce accidents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advanced systems like lane-keeping assist, parking sensors, and automatic emergency braking
          protect both drivers and pedestrians.

  <!-- Electric Cars -->
  <section>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Electric and Hybrid Vehicles</h2>
        <p>
          Electric and hybrid cars are becoming popular due to rising fuel costs and environmental concerns.
          These vehicles use electric motors and batteries to reduce pollution and fuel consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are quieter, more efficient, and help in reducing carbon emissions, making them a key part
          of sustainable transportation.

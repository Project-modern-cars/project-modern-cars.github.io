  <h1>Modern Technology of Cars</h1>
  <p>
    An overview of how modern innovations and intelligent systems have transformed cars into
    safer, smarter, and more environmentally friendly vehicles.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Cars have evolved significantly over the past few decades. Earlier, cars were mainly designed
        for transportation, but modern cars focus on safety, comfort, efficiency, and technology.
        With the integration of electronics, software, and artificial intelligence, vehicles have
        become more advanced than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern car technology aims to reduce accidents, improve fuel efficiency, and provide a better
        driving experience. Features like smart sensors, automated systems, and digital interfaces
        have changed how people interact with their vehicles.

      <h2>Key Technologies in Modern Cars</h2>
      <p>
        Modern cars are equipped with onboard computers known as Electronic Control Units (ECUs),
        which manage engine performance, braking, steering, and climate control. These systems
        help vehicles perform efficiently under different driving conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Touchscreen infotainment systems provide navigation, entertainment, and real-time traffic
        updates. Voice assistants and steering-mounted controls allow drivers to operate features
        without distraction, improving safety on the road.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smartphone connectivity through Android Auto and Apple CarPlay enables drivers to access
        calls, messages, music, and maps directly from the car’s display.

      <h2>Safety Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Safety has become a top priority in modern vehicles. Basic safety features like seat belts
        and airbags are now combined with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).
      </p>
      <p>
        Technologies such as Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Stability Control (ESC),
        and Traction Control System (TCS) help prevent skidding and loss of control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced features like lane departure warning, blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control,
        and automatic emergency braking help reduce accidents and protect passengers as well as pedestrians.

      <h2>Electric and Hybrid Vehicles</h2>
      <p>
        Electric and hybrid vehicles are an important part of modern car technology. These vehicles
        use electric motors along with batteries to reduce fuel consumption and harmful emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hybrid cars combine petrol engines with electric motors, while fully electric cars run only
        on battery power. This helps reduce air pollution and dependence on fossil fuels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many governments and automobile companies are promoting electric vehicles to support
        sustainable development and protect the environment.

      <h2>Future of Car Technology</h2>
      <p>
        The future of car technology includes autonomous or self-driving vehicles. These cars use
        artificial intelligence, cameras, radar, and sensors to navigate roads without human input.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smart traffic systems and vehicle-to-vehicle communication may reduce traffic congestion
        and accidents in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        As technology continues to evolve, cars will become more intelligent, efficient, and
        environmentally friendly, shaping the future of transportation.
